\en-abstract{
  Web3 is the next step in the evolution of the internet, the most critical innovation after the word wide web. Increasingly, applications and financial transactions will be able to be decentralized with the advent of cryptocurrencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts.\newline \indent Absolute ownership of assets is one of the main advantages of a decentralized internet. It is so that no one person or organization can control another's assets or prevent them from being transferred. The blockchain will also protect the copyright of digital assets. Even if someone copies an artist's digital art, it is still evident to everyone that the artist owns the image.\newline \indent With the benefits of ownership they provide, non-fungible tokens became very popular. The ease and convenience of minting, keeping, selling, and transferring NFTs have also encouraged the widespread use of these tokens. Many technologies and platforms have been introduced and are still being developed for this new ecosystem.\newline \indent in this project, we develop an easy-to-use platform to enable individuals and organizations to mint and transfer NFTs. In Cappu, assets such as cars, houses, movie tickets, and doctor appointments can be minted, sold, and transferred to others as an NFT.\newline \indent Even though this platform may have a wide variety of uses, the primary objective of this project is to become familiar with the process and tools of developing and deploying a smart contract, development and connections of the front end of the smart contract, and learn about standards of building a smart-contract, such as ERC721 and ERC1155.\newline \indent Moreover, Cappu is open-source, and the code can be found on Github\LTRfootnote{https://github.com/bshramin/cappu}.
